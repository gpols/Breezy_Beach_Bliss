# Breezy_Beach_Bliss

The project consists of a scene that portrays a sunny beach day with bright white clouds, where objects are affected by the wind. The idea emerged from combining works from class labs. In my first lab, I created a sand dune terrain, which inspired the concept of the beach. I incorporated objects such as a beach ball (sphere) and a buoy (torus) from a 3D lab activity. Throughout this module, I have attempted to replicate real environmental scenes or objects.
